          <p>
            The Los Angles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is a project with
            architect Peter Zumthor. The building will be roughly 350,000 square
            feet. Designed to resemble the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The complexity, tighter tolerance level, and magnitude of this Revit
            project have pushed me to create scripts and add-ins to generate
            this model. This project is a complete rethink of what Revit is
            capable of doing.

            The Revit model is geometry generated and sized using the Etabs
            model. The Revit model has never had any modeling except for the
            creation of sheets and details.

            The convention center project added more than 305,000 square feet of
            area. The project is an iconic building on Howard Street which added
            vertical levels and a bridge connecting the two sides.

          <p>
            The work I put into this project and its complexity have allowed it
            to be featured on the cover Mastering Revit 2020. Iâ€™m proud of the
            BIM model and happy it has gained recognition in the Revit world.

          <p>
            The Austin Airport project in Revit is using a Rhino model which is
            designed by the Structural Engineer. We use a CSV file to import
            line geometry, point geometry, and metadata. The color is also added
            to map member sizes to create and update the geometry in Revit.
